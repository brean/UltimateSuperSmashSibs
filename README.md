## Description
*Ultimate Super Smash Sibs* is a Competitive Co-op sibling obstacle course.

Four children were playing around in the woods when they hear their parents calling them for dinner! Feeling their empty stomaches they quickly form two teams and start their journey. Which team will win? Who's home first?

## How To Play
This game requires four players!

You can use Joysticks or a keyboard. When the game starts you see four questionmarks representing the four player. To join the game a player need to press one of his keys or axis. He can then select his Team with the left/right control and his character by the up/down control. When he is happy with his decision he presses the action key to signal that he is ready. He has to press the action key again if he likes to change his team or character again. Each character can only be used by one players and the teams need to have a size of 2 players each. Only if all 4 player are ready the game starts.
